An Open Source Slither.io Client

***Needs more contributers! Better documentation coming soon!***

## Overview

The main reason behind this bot is for educational purposes. With great power comes great responsibility, don't ruin the game for others!

Unlike many other slither.io bots, this one does not require a browser and can be ran on your desktop/server with [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org) installed

***I don't plan on adding adding advanced functionality such as AI. The bot logic relies on what you would like to do with it. This should just be used as a library.***

## Features
